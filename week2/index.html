   PIG LATIN RULES:
    - if a word begins with a vowel, the letter remains in place and 'way' is appended to the end of the word:
    apple -> appleway
    
    text + "way"
    
    - if a word begins with one consonant, that letter is moved to the end and 'ay' is appended:
    pig latin -> igpay atinlay
    
    text.slice(1) + text.substr(0, 1) + "ay"
    
    - if a word begins with two consonants, both letters are moved to the end and 'ay' is appended:
    grade -> adegray
    
    text.slice(2) + text.substr(0, 2) + "ay"
